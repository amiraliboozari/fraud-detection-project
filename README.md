# Fraud Detection Project

This is my capstone project for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate.  
The goal is to analyze financial transactions and detect fraudulent activity using both **Python/Streamlit** and **SQL + Tableau**.

## Dataset
I am using the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).  
The dataset is about 69 MB, so it is not stored directly in this repo.  
You can download it yourself from Kaggle if youâ€™d like to reproduce the project.

## Project Versions
- **Python + Streamlit:** Machine learning model, evaluation, and interactive web app.  
- **SQL + Tableau:** Business-focused analysis and dashboards.  

## Status
Work in progress ðŸš€
