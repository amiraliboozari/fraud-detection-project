# Fraud Detection Project

This is my capstone project for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate.  
The goal is to analyze financial transactions and detect fraudulent activity using both **Python/Streamlit** and **SQL + Tableau**.

🧠 Project Goals
- Investigate fraudulent transactions using SQL queries.
- Clean and transform over 6 million transaction records.
- Visualize patterns, inconsistencies, and fraud trends with Tableau dashboards.
- Build an ML-powered web app for live fraud detection (coming soon 🚀).

## Dataset
I am using the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanalisiddiqui/fraud-detection-dataset).  
The dataset is a little above 400 MB, so it is not stored directly in this repo.  
You can download it yourself from Kaggle if you’d like to reproduce the project.
